# C-Sharp Coding Projects

In this course I continued to develop my skill.  This repository contains some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

**Projects:**
_Car Insurance:_
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website.  It takes user's input on a policy information and calculates a quote based on the values that the user input.  There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all the quotes that have been issued.
